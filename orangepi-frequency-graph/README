These results were gathered on an Orange Pi 800 system running
Linux orangepi800 5.18.5-rk3399 #3.0.8 SMP PREEMPT Mon Sep 26 15:06:13 CST 2022 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux

The data was gathered with the
	wattsup-fancy.c
tool that logs power from a WattsUpPro power meter along with temperature
information.  This tool can be found in this git repo:
	https://github.com/deater/uarch-configure/tree/master/wattsup
The version used for the measurements is included here.
	
The graphs were generated using the "jgraph" tool by Jim Plank

To separate the columns for plotting, awk is used, something like
	awk '{print $1-1719435972 " " $2}' hpl.results 
and to reduce the frequencies something like
	awk '{print $1-1719435972 " " $2/1000}' hpl.results
